Project Idea: Automatic Recognition of Environmental Pollution Levels from Street Images

Objective: Develop a CNN model to classify street images based on their pollution levels, helping in environmental monitoring and urban planning.

Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, ImageDataGenerator, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Data Augmentation, Max Pooling, Early Stopping, Image Preprocessing, Model Evaluation, Jupyter Notebook

Developed a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras to classify street images into different pollution levels, achieving 96.40% accuracy
Optimized hyperparameters and used early stopping to prevent overfitting, visualizing training trends with Matplotlib to 
ensure robust model performance
Impact: Enabled accurate and automated pollution level classification, supporting environmental monitoring and decision-making
