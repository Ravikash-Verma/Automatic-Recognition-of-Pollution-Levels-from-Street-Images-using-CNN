Project Idea: Automatic Recognition of Environmental Pollution Levels from Street Images

Objective: Develop a CNN model to classify street images based on their pollution levels, helping in environmental monitoring and urban planning.

Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, ImageDataGenerator, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Data Augmentation, Max Pooling, Early Stopping, Image Preprocessing, Model Evaluation, Jupyter Notebook

•	Developed a CNN using TensorFlow and Keras with convolutional layers, max-pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers to classify street images into six pollution levels, achieving 89.8% validation and 89.79% test accuracy with data augmentation for enhanced generalization.

•	Optimized hyperparameters such as filters, nodes, loss function, activation, epochs, etc., leveraging early stopping to prevent overfitting and visualized training trends using Matplotlib to ensure robust model performance.

Impact: Enabled accurate and automated pollution level classification from street images, supporting environmental monitoring and decision-making.
